# MyBambu IMT Strategic Plan
## October 2025 Analysis & Recommendations

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State:** The IMT (International Money Transfer) product is **losing $78,047 per month** (-23.3% margin) with a **25.4% monthly churn rate**.

**Root Causes:**
- Fee structure (0.75% FX, $0.85 bank, $2.49 cash) generates only $334K revenue
- Rail costs (2%) consume $412K monthly
- Customer lifetime is only 3.9 months due to high churn
- Customer LTV of $46 cannot support acquisition spending

**Recommended Solution:**
- **Implement Scenario 5 Pricing** (1.0% FX, $1.49 bank fee, $2.49 cash)
- **Negotiate rail costs** from 2.0% to 1.5%
- **Launch retention campaign** to reduce churn from 25% to <15%

**Expected Impact:** Turn -$78K monthly loss into +$110K monthly profit (+$2.26M annual swing)

## 📉 CHURN & RETENTION CRISIS

### Monthly Churn Analysis
- **September Cohort:** 27,940 users
- **Retained in October:** 20,844 users (74.6%)
- **Churned:** 7,096 users (25.4%)

### 🔴 **MONTHLY CHURN RATE: 25.4%**

**What This Means:**
- Losing **1 in 4 customers every month**
- Average customer lifetime: **3.9 months**
- Need to acquire 7,096+ new users monthly just to maintain flat growth

### October User Breakdown
- 🆕 New Users: 3,193 (11.2%)
- 🔄 Returning Users: 25,358 (88.8%)

**⚠️ Red Flag:** New user acquisition (3,193) is less than half of churn (7,096)
- Net user loss: -3,903 users (-14%)
- Product is shrinking, not growing

## 🎯 PRICING STRATEGY - PATH TO PROFITABILITY

### Fee Scenarios Tested

| Scenario | FX | Bank | Cash | Revenue | Margin | Status |
|----------|-----|------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Current** | 0.75% | $0.85 | $2.49 | $334K | **-$78K** | 🔴 Losing |
| Scenario 1 | 1.0% | $0.85 | $2.49 | $386K | -$26K | 🔴 Still losing |
| Scenario 2 | 1.5% | $0.85 | $2.49 | $489K | +$77K | ✅ Profitable |
| Scenario 3 | 0.75% | $1.49 | $2.49 | $368K | -$45K | 🔴 Still losing |
| **Scenario 5** ⭐ | **1.0%** | **$1.49** | **$2.49** | **$419K** | **+$7K** | ✅ **Profitable** |
| Scenario 6 | 1.5% | $1.99 | $3.99 | $630K | +$217K | ✅ Highly Profitable |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Scenario 5 (Conservative Win)

**New Fee Structure:**
- FX Spread: 0.75% → **1.0%** (+0.25pp)
- Bank Account Fee: $0.85 → **$1.49** (+$0.64)
- Cash Retail Fee: **$2.49** (no change)

**Impact:**
- Monthly Revenue: $334K → **$419K** (+25%)
- Monthly Margin: -$78K → **+$7K** (profitable!)
- Annual Swing: **+$1.01M**

**Why Scenario 5:**
1. Reaches profitability with minimal pricing changes
2. Keeps cash fee competitive at $2.49
3. FX at 1.0% is still below competitors (Remitly ~2-3%, Western Union ~3-5%)
4. Provides buffer for retention campaigns and marketing

---

## 💡 ALTERNATIVE: Balanced Break-Even Approach

If Scenario 5 feels too aggressive, here's a more gradual approach:

**Balanced Fee Structure:**
- FX Spread: 0.75% → **0.90%** (+0.15pp)
- Bank Fee: $0.85 → **$1.30** (+$0.45)
- Cash Fee: $2.49 → **$2.92** (+$0.43)

**Impact:** Exact break-even (0% margin, $0 profit/loss)

This gives you room to negotiate and test pricing elasticity.

## 🔧 RAIL COST NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### Current Situation
- Paying 2.0% rail costs on $20.6M volume
- Monthly cost: $412,442
- This is **123% of current revenue** ($334K)

### Negotiation Targets

| Rail Cost % | Monthly Cost | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Current: 2.0%** | $412,442 | - | - |
| **1.75%** | $360,887 | +$51,555 | +$619K |
| **1.5%** | $309,332 | +$103,110 | +$1.24M |
| **1.25%** | $257,776 | +$154,666 | +$1.86M |

### 🎯 Target: 1.5% Rail Cost

**Combined with Scenario 5 Pricing:**
- Revenue: $419K
- Rail Cost: $309K (was $412K)
- **New Margin: +$110K monthly** (26.2% margin)
- **Annual Profit: $1.32M**

**Negotiation Leverage:**
- $20.6M monthly volume ($247M annual)
- Growing customer base (28K+ users)
- Long-term partnership potential

## 👥 CUSTOMER SEGMENT PROFITABILITY

### Current Profitability by Segment (All Unprofitable)

| Segment | Users | % | Avg Vol/User | Revenue/User | Profit/User | Status |
|---------|-------|---|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Frequent (7-10 txns) | 2,696 | 9.4% | $1,540 | $25.08 | **-$5.73** | 🔴 |
| Power (10+ txns) | 2,230 | 7.8% | $1,177 | $22.06 | **-$1.48** | 🔴 |

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Customer Backlash to Price Increase
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Soft launch with A/B test (50% of users)
- Grandfather existing Power Users for 90 days
- Emphasize value adds (faster processing, better support)
- Offer "lock-in" rate for users who commit to 5+ txns/month

**Monitoring:**
- Track transaction volume daily
- Monitor customer support tickets
- Survey sample of users

**Contingency:**
- If volume drops >15%, roll back to Balanced Approach (0.90% FX, $1.30 bank)
- Offer promotional credits to high-value users

---

### Risk 2: Rail Cost Negotiation Fails
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Develop relationships with 2-3 alternative rail providers
- Get competitive quotes to use as leverage
- Consider hybrid approach (multi-rail strategy)
- Explore blockchain/crypto rails for specific corridors

**Contingency:**
- If stuck at 2%, must go to Scenario 6 pricing (1.5% FX, $1.99 bank, $3.99 cash)
- Consider passing rail costs directly to customer (transparent pricing model)

---

### Risk 3: Retention Campaign Fails to Improve Churn
**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Pilot retention offers with small cohort (500 users)
- Test multiple offer types (free txn, discount, credit)
- Conduct exit surveys to understand churn drivers
- Implement win-back automation

**Contingency:**
- If churn stays >20%, LTV remains low ($58 vs. $85 target)
- Must rely more heavily on new user acquisition
- Increase marketing budget accordingly

---

### Risk 4: Competitive Response
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor competitor pricing weekly
- Maintain 10-15% cost advantage vs. Western Union, MoneyGram
- Differentiate on speed, reliability, customer service
- Build brand loyalty through community engagement

**Contingency:**
- If competitors undercut pricing, focus on premium service tier
- Consider strategic partnerships (e.g., employer partnerships)

---

### Risk 5: Regulatory Changes
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor CFPB, FinCEN, state money transmitter requirements
- Maintain compliance buffer (extra capital, licensing)
- Engage legal counsel proactively
- Join industry associations for early warning

**Contingency:**
- Have 6-12 month compliance roadmap ready
- Budget $100K for emergency compliance needs
